export var about_me = `How I would describe myself? Passionate. Very passionate and curious. I am passionate about creativity, in anywhere it could be applied. I love to create and the process of making something; anything really, fuels me with joy. To be able to confidntly say "I did that!" and look upon my work with nothing but joy, pride and a feeling of accomplishment. So that's why I dabble in alot of differnt things (as you would soon see), just so I can answer the question "What can I create?"`
